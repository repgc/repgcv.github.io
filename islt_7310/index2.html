        <p>Hello, my name is Rebecca and welcome to my website. 
            This website is a glimpse into who I am as well as the projects I have completed relating to my major of Textile and 
            Apparel Management throughout college.   
         </p>
         <p> The purpose of this website is to dive deeper into who I am as well as how I am applicable for the 
             current position I am applying to. 
             This website will include projects that I have completed through college, such as Fashion Scholarship 
             Fund competition projects as well as projects completed in the classroom. Also, these projects will show 
             the areas that I am interested in within the fashion industry. For example, I am interested in e-commerce 
             in the fashion industry. The objectives of the website are to show the ideas and work I am capable of. 
             The goal of the website is to be able to use it to further show an employer who I am and what I am capable of. 
             A resume can show this, but this website will have them further understand who I am as an individual as well as a future employee.</p></div>
