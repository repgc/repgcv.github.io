        <h2>Welcome</h2>
        <p>
            Hello, my name is Rebecca and welcome to my website. 
            This website is a glimpse into who I am as well as the projects I have completed relating to my major of Textile and Apparel Management throughout college. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            The purpose of this website is to dive deeper into who I am as well as how I am applicable for the current position I am applying to. 
            This website will include projects that I have completed through college, such as Fashion Scholarship Fund competition projects as well as 
            projects completed in the classroom. Also, these projects will show the areas that I am interested in within the fashion industry. 
            For example, I am interested in e-commerce in the fashion industry. The objectives of the website are to show the ideas and work I am capable of. 
            The goal of the website is to be able to use it to further show an employer who I am and what I am capable of. 
            A resume can show this, but this website will have them further understand who I am as an individual as well as a future employee.
