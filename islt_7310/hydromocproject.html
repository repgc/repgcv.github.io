        <p> This is the second project I competed with in the Fashion Scholarship Fund. For this project, I was tasked with choosing a social 
            zeitgeist that many people are interested in and create a product that will fit the zeitgeist. The social zeitgeist I chose was 
            “Comfort at home during these uncertain times” since I was competing in the competition during Fall 2020. The brand I chose was Merrel, 
            since they already have a product called the Hydro Moc. I decided to change the product by altering the colors for them to go with more ensembles. 
            Also, the shoe could be worn both inside and outside for maximum convenience.  
        </p>
        <p>
            Even though I did not win a scholarship from this project, I was able to learn about how consumers had changed their shopping habits during the 
            pandemic. Since many were at home, comfort was key. However, now that more people are going back to working or learning in-person, 
            consumers are starting to want to dress up again.
