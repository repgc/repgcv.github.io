        <p>During my time at Mizzou, I have taken many courses in different departments, such as Textile and Apparel Management, Business, and IT. 
            Because of each of these courses, I know that I have grown in many different areas in the industry. I have enjoyed my merchandising and marketing 
            classes, but they have been more valuable because of the knowledge I have learned in both business and IT.   
         </p>
         <p> So far, the most interesting classes to me within Textile and Apparel Management have been digital merchandising as well as my writing intensive 
             fashion history course. When going into the digital merchandising course, I was able to learn more about a company’s website and how it functions 
             successfully. In my fashion history course, I was able to learn about the evolution of women’s fashion, such as how waistline’s have changed.
        </p>
        <p>
            The most interesting class to me within the business school was Macroeconomics. During this course, I was able to learn about the basics of 
            supply and demand as well as how inflation works. Having this knowledge has helped me during my major courses.
        </p>
        <p>
            My career goals after I graduate in May 2022 is to move to New York City. The opportunities are endless in the city, and I am very excited to get
             my foot in the door right when I graduate. My dream career would be to either have an e-commerce merchandising or digital marketing position.
