     My name is Hayden and I am a senior a Mizzou studying, well not real sure. I am 25 and still have no idea what I like doing every day in life so a career path is tough for me to decide. I have two children one being a stepson Ayden who is 8 and Ayble is 2. I unfortunately have a mortgage but have 5 paid off cars, hence priorities. My house looks like a junkyard according to my wife. I enjoying being outdoors and getting paid to tan. Summer is my favorite season with no other seasons being my next favorite because they are too cold. This is an odd class for me to take for one reason, I do not like browsing the web and in general, can not find any information or navigate the innerweb well. My goal for this course is to be able to navigate the internet a little better so I can find relevant information. An interesting fact about me is that I am a homebody.
