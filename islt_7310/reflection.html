        <h2>Reflection About My Experience at Mizzou</h2>
        <p>
            During my time at Mizzou, I have taken many courses in different departments, such as Textile and Apparel Management, 
            Business, and IT. Because of each of these courses, I know that I have grown in many different areas in the industry.
            I have enjoyed my merchandising and marketing classes, but they have been more valuable because of the knowledge 
            I have learned in both business and IT. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            So far, the most interesting classes to me within Textile and Apparel Management have been digital merchandising as 
            well as my writing intensive fashion history course. When going into the digital merchandising course, I was able to 
            learn more about a company’s website and how it functions successfully. In my fashion history course, I was able to 
            learn about the evolution of women’s fashion, such as how waistline’s have changed. 
        </p>

            The most interesting class to me within the business school was Macroeconomics. During this course, 
            I was able to learn about the basics of supply and demand as well as how inflation works. 
            Having this knowledge has helped me during my major courses.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            My career goals after I graduate in May 2022 is to move to New York City. The opportunities are endless in the city, 
            and I am very excited to get my foot in the door right when I graduate. My dream career would be to either have 
            an e-commerce merchandising or digital marketing position.
