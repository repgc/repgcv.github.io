    Hello, my name is Rebecca. I am a senior at Mizzou studying Textile and Apparel Management, specifically Marketing and Merchandising. I am receiving a minor in Business and an Information Systems certificate. I have little web development experience heading into this course. In high school, I participated in a summer camp called Kode with Klossy that taught girls basic web development skills; the skills include HTML and CSS. I have been taking IT courses at Mizzou since the spring semester of sophomore year. My expectation for this course is to better understand front-end web development. My goal after this class is to create my own blog about my life after college. In my free time, I like to run and do other cardio workouts. Also, I enjoy spending time with friends and family. I like thrift shopping and reading articles about the latest fashion trends in our world today.
